# WhatsApp Automation with Selenium (Java)

## Overview
This project was developed as part of a **Programming Workshop** course. It automates the process of sending messages through **WhatsApp Web** using **Selenium WebDriver** with **Java**. The goal was to simulate user interactions, such as logging into WhatsApp Web and sending messages to a given contact or group.

## Challenges
One of the main challenges we faced was understanding how to query the correct HTML elements on WhatsApp Web. This was our first time using Selenium, so we had to learn how to properly navigate and interact with dynamic HTML components. By learning HTML and CSS selectors, we overcame this challenge and successfully implemented the solution.
## What We Learned
Throughout this project, we gained valuable hands-on experience with:
- **Selenium WebDriver**: We learned how to automate web interactions and navigate complex web applications.
- **HTML/CSS Selectors**: By studying the WhatsApp Web interface, we deepened our understanding of how to use different selectors (like XPath and CSS) to find and interact with HTML elements.
- **Debugging and Error Handling**: While querying elements, we encountered several errors related to dynamic content. This taught us the importance of robust debugging and learning how to handle delays and load times on modern web pages.

These lessons have given us a deeper appreciation for web automation, and we look forward to using these skills in future projects.
